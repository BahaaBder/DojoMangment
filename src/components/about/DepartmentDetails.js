        Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact combat sport
         that allows a wide variety of fighting techniques and skills 
         from a mixture of other combat sports to be used in competition.
          The rules allow usage of both striking and grappling techniques 
          while standing and on the ground. Competitions allow athletes of 
          different disciplines of martial arts to compete under a set of
           unified rules. `

         using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge 
         of the human anatomy, in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one’s opponent.
          Unlike other martial arts that focus on strikes and/or kicks, jiu jitsu focuses on close-contact
           “grappling” holds and techniques, and the application of chokes and joint-manipulations.`

          rounds. Winners are decided by points or by knocking out an

                grappling and trying to spin an enemy to the ground for the kill.`
